## Objection Handling

### Price Objection
*"Your solution is more expensive than Competitor1."*

**Response:** "I understand cost is important. Let me share how to think about total cost of ownership. Competitor1's headline price is lower, but customers who've switched to us report spending 40% less engineering time on maintenance. With an engineering cost of $150k+/year, even saving one engineer 10 hours/month pays for the difference. Would it be helpful to walk through the ROI calculator with your actual numbers?"

### Timing Objection
*"We're not ready to make a decision right now."*

**Response:** "That's completely fair. What would need to happen for you to be ready? Often we find starting a technical evaluation now means you're ready to move quickly when budget timing aligns. Would it make sense to do the security review and technical deep-dive now so those aren't blockers later?"

### Feature Objection
*"You don't have [specific feature]."*

**Response:** "Tell me more about how you'd use that feature. Sometimes there's an alternative approach in our platform, and sometimes it's genuinely a gap. We have a transparent roadmap process - if it's a common request, I can share where it falls in our priorities."
